      <h2>Steak and Potatoes</h2>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
<li>1 1/2 lb flank steak, sliced against the grain (or ribeye steak, tenderloin, strip loin, strip steak…)</li>
<li>1 1/2 lb small yellow potatoes, quartered</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
<li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, chopped</li>
<li>Salt and fresh cracked pepper</li>
<li>Crushed red chili pepper flakes, optional</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>To prepare the garlic butter steak recipe with potatoes wedges: In a large bowl, combine the steak strips with soy sauce, olive oil, pepper, and hot sauce. Set aside and allow steak strips to marinate while you cook potatoes.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When butter is melted, add potatoes wedges. Cook for about 4 minutes, stir and cook an additional 4-5 minutes until potatoes wedges are golden and fork-tender. Transfer sauteed potatoes to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Keep the same skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, garlic, red chili pepper flakes, and fresh herbs. Lay the steak strips in one layer in the skillet, keeping the drained steak marinade for later. Cook the steak strips on each side for 1 minute each, until nicely browned – adjust timing depending on how you like your steak.</li>
        <li>Right before the Garlic Butter steak is done, you can stir in the reserved marinade if you like, and cook for one minute. Add the potatoes wedges back to the garlic butter steak pan and heat through. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately your steak and potatoes, garnished with more crushed chili pepper, fresh herbs, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the potatoes if you like. Enjoy!</li>

      <h2>Chicken</h2>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
<li>1¾ lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
<li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>4 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons lemon zest, from one lemon</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>One at a time, place the chicken breasts in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag; using a meat mallet, pound to an even ½-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Mix all of the ingredients except for the chicken together in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag (go ahead and use the same one you used for pounding if it is still in good shape).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken breasts to the bag and massage the marinade into the meat until evenly coated. Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator (the bowl protects against leakage); let the chicken marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high heat and oil the grates. Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook, covered, for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not overcook. Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve.</li>

      <h2>Burger</h2>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>

<li>1 ½ pounds ground beef, about 20 percent fat</li>
<li>Black pepper and salt</li>
<li>Squared cheese slices of your choice (optional)</li>
<li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Start your grill (we're cooking these hot and fast!). Form the patties into 3/4-inch burgers, being careful not to make them too loose or too large. </li>
        <li>Make a deep depression in the center of each burger with your thumb. Season both sides of the each burger aggressively with kosher salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place burgers on a hot grill and cook, without moving, for about 3 minutes. Use a spatula to turn the hamburger over. </li>
        <li>If using cheese, lay slices on the meat.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook until the burgers are cooked through, about another 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the burgers from the grill and allow to rest for a few minutes while you toast the buns. Top the burgers as you wish!</li>
