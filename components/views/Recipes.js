      <h2>Steak</h2>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
<li>1 1/2 lb flank steak, sliced against the grain (or ribeye steak, tenderloin, strip loin, strip steak…)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
<li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, chopped</li>
<li>Salt and fresh cracked pepper</li>
<li>Crushed red chili pepper flakes, optional</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>To prepare the garlic butter steak recipe: In a large bowl, combine the steak strips with soy sauce, olive oil, pepper, and hot sauce. Set aside and allow steak strips to marinate.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 3 tablespoons butter.
        <li>When butter is melted, add garlic, red chili pepper flakes, and fresh herbs. Lay the steak strips in one layer in the skillet, keeping the drained steak marinade for later. Cook the steak strips on each side for 1 minute each, until nicely browned – adjust timing depending on how you like your steak. (You can use the thumb test for internal temp of steak.)</li>
        <li>Right before the Garlic Butter steak is done, you can stir in the reserved marinade if you like, and cook for one minute. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let steak rest for about 5 minutes. Garnish with more crushed chili pepper and fresh herbs if you like. Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Chicken</h2>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
<li>1¾ lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
<li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>4 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons lemon zest, from one lemon</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>One at a time, place the chicken breasts in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag; using a meat mallet, pound to an even ½-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Mix all of the ingredients except for the chicken together in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag (go ahead and use the same one you used for pounding if it is still in good shape).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken breasts to the bag and massage the marinade into the meat until evenly coated. Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator (the bowl protects against leakage); let the chicken marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high heat and oil the grates. Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook, covered, for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not overcook. Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Burger</h2>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
<li>1 ½ pounds ground beef, about 20 percent fat</li>
<li>Black pepper and salt</li>
<li>Squared cheese slices of your choice (optional)</li>
<li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Start your grill (we're cooking these hot and fast!). Form the patties into 3/4-inch burgers, being careful not to make them too loose or too large. </li>
        <li>Make a deep depression in the center of each burger with your thumb. Season both sides of the each burger aggressively with kosher salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place burgers on a hot grill and cook, without moving, for about 3 minutes. Use a spatula to turn the hamburger over. </li>
        <li>If using cheese, lay slices on the meat.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook until the burgers are cooked through, about another 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the burgers from the grill and allow to rest for a few minutes while you toast the buns. Top the burgers as you wish!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Vegetarian</h2>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
<li>1 Medium Zucchini</li>
<li>3 Medium Carrots</li>
<li>12 ounces Baby Potatoes (350 grams)</li>
<li>1 Large Red Onion</li>
<li>2-4 Garlic Heads</li>
<li>4 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Dried Garlic</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Sweet Paprika</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Marjoram</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon Salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill to 400°F.</li>
        <li>Cut the zucchini into chunks. Peel and slice the carrots. Cut the baby potatoes into quarters. As for the onion – cut it either into rings or quarters. Trim the top of each garlic head (about ¼ to ⅓ – where the stem is) so that the cloves are exposed. The outer skin should easily come off at this stage. There is no need to remove everything, just the ones that go easily.</li>
        <li>Now place all the veggies in a large bowl, except for the garlic heads. Drizzle the oil over.</li>
        <li>Prepare the spice mix by combining all the ingredients in a small bowl. Now sprinkle the seasoning over the veggies and give them a good toss until they are all coated evenly.</li>
        <li>Divide the veggies into 4 sheets of foil. Now take the garlic head and place it the open side down into the large bowl where the veggies were. Press down so the cloves suck the juices (oil + seasoning). Repeat with the rest of them. Place them in the middle of each packet.</li>
        <li>Wrap each packet tight and place them onto a baking tray. Bake them for 30-35 minutes or until the veggies are done.</li>
      </ol>
